/*
Given a string, , matching the regular expression [A-Za-z !,?._'@]+, split the string into tokens. We define a token to be one or more consecutive English alphabetic letters. Then, print the number of tokens, followed by each token on a new line.

Note: You may find the String.split method helpful in completing this challenge.

Input Format

A single string, .

Constraints

 is composed of any of the following: English alphabetic letters, blank spaces, exclamation points (!), commas (,), question marks (?), periods (.), underscores (_), apostrophes ('), and at symbols (@).
Output Format

On the first line, print an integer, , denoting the number of tokens in string  (they do not need to be unique). Next, print each of the  tokens on a new line in the same order as they appear in input string .

Sample Input

He is a very very good boy, isn't he?
Sample Output

10
He
is
a
very
very
good
boy
isn
t
he
